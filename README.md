# Android Clean Architecture with MVVM using Jetpack component


## ðŸ’¡ What is Clean Architecture?

Clean architecture is a category of software design pattern for software architecture that follows the concepts of clean code and implements [SOLID principles](https://codersee.com/solid-principles-with-kotlin-examples/)

Itâ€™s essentially a collection of best practice design principles that help you keep business logic, or domain logic, together and minimize the dependencies within the system.

Clean architecture is a method of software development in which you should be able to identify what a program performs merely by looking at its source code. Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, came up with the Clean Architecture concept in the year 2012.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Clean Architecture?

Separation of Concerns â€” Separation of code in different modules or sections with specific responsibilities making it easier for maintenance and further modification.
Loose coupling â€” flexible code anything can be easily be changed without changing the system
Easily Testable


## ðŸ’¡ Layers of clean architecture

- **Presentation or UI:**
  A layer that interacts with the UI, mainly Android Stuff like Activities, Fragments, ViewModel, etc. It is dependent on Use Cases.
- **Domain:** 
  Contains the business logic of the application. It is the individual and innermost module.
- **Data:**
  It includes the domain layer. It would implement the interface exposed by domain layer and dispenses data to app

## ðŸ’¡ Advantages of Using Clean Architecture
- Easily testable.
- Scalable.
- Your team can add new features even more quickly.
- The project is even easier to maintain.
